          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>Based on the data collected from the 2014 Census ACS 1-year estimates, several different analyses about health risks can be conducted.
            For this example, the comparison being made is between each states poverty and healthcare percentages. 
            The chart above shows the level of healthcare per state and their corresponding poverty level. As you can see, it appears that states which 
            have a higher percentage of the population in poverty also have higher percentages of the population lacking healthcare. Likely there are other factors 
            that are contribute to this correlation, but the above chart solely focuses on povery vs. healthcare.</p>

          <p>When hovering the tooltip over the circles in the graph, the top left corner of the webpage will display the states name along with the percentage value 
            of the states population which lacks healthcare, with the percentage of those in poverty following that value.</p>

          <p>There are some other analyses that could have been made using the census data, such as the percentage of the population who smoke, or are obese, vs. median age
            or household income.</p>
